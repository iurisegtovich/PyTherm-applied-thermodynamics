    "In this notebook, you were introduced to some fundamental aspects of programming, using Python language. Along with them, you were also introduced to some of the core principles of Thermodynamics, like the First Law and the operation of cycles. After studying this notebook, you should be able to write code in Python in order to solve simple problems either by using it as calculator or by creating simple functions. The following notebooks will address more complex code structures and thermodynamic issues, thus we recommend that the subjects we addressed here are well understood by you before you continue your journey to master the Applied Thermodynamics knowledge."
